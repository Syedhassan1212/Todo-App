# To-Do List App

A simple web-based To-Do List app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add tasks, view them dynamically, and mark them as done.

## Features
- Add a new task with a title and description.
- Dynamically generate and display tasks.
- Mark tasks as "Done" with a single click.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS**: (Optional) Modern styling for a sleek design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles app logic like adding and marking tasks.

## Concepts Learned

Through this project, I practiced the following concepts:

1. **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**  
   - Creating and modifying elements dynamically using JavaScript.  
   - Using `document.createElement()` and `appendChild()` for generating and appending elements.

2. **Event Handling**  
   - Attaching events like `onclick` to interact with elements dynamically.

3. **Attributes Management**  
   - Dynamically assigning attributes using `setAttribute()` to customize elements.

4. **Using IDs for Targeting**  
   - Utilizing unique IDs to manage specific elements in the DOM (e.g., marking tasks as done).

5. **Code Modularization**  
   - Writing reusable functions like `createChild()` and `markAsDone()` to keep code organized.

6. **Global Variables**  
   - Using a global counter to generate unique IDs for tasks.

7. **HTML Form Inputs**  
   - Capturing user inputs using `document.getElementById()` and integrating them into dynamic content.


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter a title and description for your task and click "Add todo."
4. Click the "Mark as done" button to mark a task as completed.
